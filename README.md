# Multi-Digit--Hand-Written-Recognition-Using-MNIST
Recognition of  Multi Digit Hand written and Adding Manual images to MNIST data set  to increase accuracy
The MNIST handwritten digit classification problem is a standard dataset used in computer vision and deep learning.

Although the dataset is effectively solved, it can be used as the basis for learning and practicing how to develop, evaluate, and use convolutional deep learning neural networks for image classification from scratch. This includes how to develop a robust test harness for estimating the performance of the model, how to explore improvements to the model, and how to save the model and later load it to make predictions on new data.
